/**
 * Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays, val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the items such that sum of the weights of those items of a given subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
