# Spanning Tree

  Spanning tree of a Graph is a sub tree of the graph, which includes all the connected vertices of the graph and is acyclic.

## Properties of Spanning Tree

    - No. of vertices in spanning tree should be same as that of the graph.
    - No. of edges of a spanning tree is v - 1.
    - vertices in a spanning tree cannot be disconnected.
    - Cost of the Spanning tree is the sum of weights of all its edges.

## Minimum Spanning Tree

    A spanning tree who cost is minimal among all other spanning trees of the graph.
